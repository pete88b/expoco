    "### Goal\n",
    "\n",
    "Control the pointer using facial expressions. e.g.\n",
    "- eyes control pointer position\n",
    "- blink, cheek puff, head tilt etc could control clicks\n",
    "- switched on/off with a shrug\n",
    "\n",
    "### Why\n",
    "\n",
    "Improve workflows by removing the need to leave the keyboard \"home poisition\". e.g.\n",
    "- moving between different lines of code/text\n",
    "- moving to a specific section of a different window\n",
    "\n",
    "### Feasibility and Value\n",
    "- feasibility - aim to complete in < 1 week\n",
    "    - get pointer position control working\n",
    "    - show that we can get F1 > 90% for 3 expressions\n",
    "- value \n",
    "    - can we use the above to augment pointer control without being intrusive\n",
    "        - i.e. can we do some of the \"Why\" by partially achieving some goal(s)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key metrics\n",
    "\n",
    "Inference time (latency / frames|queries per second) \n",
    "- eye position tracking and expression classification must happen without noticable lag - TODO: define acceptable lag\n",
    "\n",
    "define max impact on system \n",
    "- it's no use if running this thing if it makes everything else run too slow\n",
    "\n",
    "pointer position MAE or MSE? - how many pixels of error are acceptable - under which circumstances\n",
    "- both MSE and MAE can be converted to a number of pixels (strait line from target)\n",
    "\n",
    "treat each expression as a binary classification\n",
    "- maybe some expression need to be more accurate than others\n",
    "    - \"more accurate\" might mean better\n",
    "        - Precision: When a positive value is predicted, how often is the prediction correct?\n",
    "        - Precision tp/(tp+fp) / Recall (tp/(tp+fn)) / F1 2/((1/P)+(1/R))\n",
    "        - AUC ... or\n",
    "        - accuracy\n",
    "- we will probably want to minimize false -ve - with some kind of accuracy threshold\n",
    "    - TODO: not sure this is right &uarr; it might be the case that fp and fn are equaly problematic\n",

    "### Notes\n",
    "- mouse poition only make a difference if we're\n",
    "    - hovering for tooltip\n",
